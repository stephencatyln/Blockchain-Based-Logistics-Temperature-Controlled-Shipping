# Blockchain-Based Logistics Temperature-Controlled Shipping

This repository implements a decentralized solution for managing and verifying temperature-controlled logistics across the supply chain. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system creates immutable records of shipping conditions, carrier qualifications, and compliance with temperature requirements for sensitive cargo.

## Core Components

### Carrier Verification Contract
- Digital registry of qualified refrigerated transportation providers
- Credential verification and certification tracking
- Equipment compliance documentation
- Performance history and rating system

### Shipment Registration Contract
- Detailed cargo specifications and temperature requirements
- Pickup and delivery parameters
- Chain of custody documentation
- Digital bill of lading and shipping manifest

### Monitoring Contract
- Real-time environmental condition tracking
- IoT sensor integration for temperature, humidity, and location
- Threshold alerts and notification system
- Tamper-proof recording of all measurement data

### Compliance Verification Contract
- Automated validation of temperature maintenance
- Deviation reporting and exception handling
- End-to-end compliance certification
- Smart contract enforcement of shipping requirements

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Quality Assurance**: Verifiable proof of continuous temperature control
- **Reduced Spoilage**: Immediate alerts for potential temperature excursions
- **Streamlined Auditing**: Immutable records for regulatory compliance
- **Supply Chain Transparency**: Real-time visibility for all stakeholders
- **Automated Settlements**: Condition-based payment execution

## Implementation

The system integrates IoT temperature sensors with blockchain infrastructure to create a trustless verification mechanism for temperature-sensitive shipments like pharmaceuticals, food products, and biological materials.

## Getting Started

Setup instructions and integration guides can be found in the documentation directory. The system supports integration with existing logistics management platforms through standardized APIs.
